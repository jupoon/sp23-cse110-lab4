** Lab 4 Part 1 Answers

1. Line 9 prints `values added: 20`. 
2. Line 13 prints `final result: 20`. 
3. Line 9 prints `values added: 20`.
4. Code returns an error, since `result` was defined only in the `if` block. Since `result` doesn't exist outside of that block, line 13 cannot print `result`.
5. code returns an error. Since the const keyword does not allow a variable to be changed, line 7 returns an error because it tried to assign a new value to `result`, which cannot happen.
6. Code returns an error for the same reason as in question5; it is never reached because line 7 is erroneous.
